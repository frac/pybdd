h2.pyBdd

yeah the name is silly and pretensious but you have to start somewhere

h3.What?
    
Just a silly project and a dirty hack (so far) to see if I can use a DSL to generate and run tests in python

h3.Why?

Because I didn't find what I needed so I shut up and coded

h3.Really?

Not exactally. The most excelent pyccuracy almost does what I want, I could rewrite the browser driver to make it run tests not only browser tests..

h3.Haven't you heard that BDD in python is done on doctest?

Oh! Thousands of times, ok maybe couple of times, but doctest does not cut for me:

I want to write recipes of test, some thing like login as a user, do this, do that, this should happen.

I try to do that in doctest I don't fell that it is too much DRY
